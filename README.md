# Machine Learning Coursera: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

1. In the first part of this exercise, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to 
compress an image.
2. In the second part, you will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation 
of face images.
